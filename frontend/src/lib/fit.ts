/**
 * Fit-gauge magnitudes for recommendation cards (#222 / recalibrated #240).
 *
 * The gauge shows **適合度 (fit strength)**, derived from the candidate's composite
 * score — NOT the qualitative 高/中/低 confidence label. The two are deliberately
 * decoupled (#240): after #110 the label reflects the *kind of evidence* (a topic
 * with no prior answers is 低 even for a strong candidate), so anchoring the gauge
 * to the label made a well-qualified #1 read as a 33%-capped poor match on any
 * never-asked topic. Now the gauge reads the actual fit and the label rides along
 * as a separate evidence badge (ConfidenceGauge shows both).
 *
 * The raw `score` is a weighted sum (scorer/weights.py). The base positive weights
 * (topic_fit .45 + recency .15 + answer_quality .20 + proximity .10) sum to 0.90,
 * BUT the question-fit term (#405, `question_fit_enabled` default ON) adds
 * `question_fit(1.0) · qsim` on top, where qsim ∈ [0, 1]. So the real composite
 * ceiling is 0.90 + 1.0 = 1.90, not 0.90 (#498). Normalising against 0.90 made any
 * candidate with a non-trivial qsim saturate at 100% — the "適合度が100ばかり" bug.
 * We normalise against the qsim-inclusive ceiling so the gauge de-saturates and
 * differentiates candidates again.
 *
 * TRADE-OFF (interim): because the frontend only receives the FINAL score, it
 * cannot separate the base term from qsim, so a genuinely strong topic expert with
 * NO matching past answer (base ~0.9, qsim 0) now reads ~47% rather than ~100%.
 * The proper fix is to have the backend — which knows the components and the active
 * weights — compute and send a normalised fit percent (follow-up to #498), removing
 * this single-ceiling guess entirely. The exact ceiling is theoretical, not eval-
 * calibrated; recalibrate on the eval when the embedder / weights change.
