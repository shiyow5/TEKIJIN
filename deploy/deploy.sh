# Deploy TEKIJIN to the DGX from a self-hosted-runner checkout (#203).
#
# Runs ON the DGX (a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner, user team_a). The runner
# has checked out the develop commit into $GITHUB_WORKSPACE; this script syncs that
# tree into the live deploy dir, rebuilds the frontend, restarts the backend, and
# health-checks. On failure it restores the previous release (rollback).
#
# HARD RULES (shared GPU host):
#   * vLLM (tekijin_vllm) and Postgres (tekijin_app_pg) are NEVER touched — the GPU
#     is occupied and a restart would drop the model / the DB. Only the backend
#     (nohup uvicorn on :18000) and the frontend container are cycled.
#   * No sudo: the runner user is not root. Restart is process/docker level only.
#
# Everything is overridable via env (defaults match the DGX):
#   TEKIJIN_DEPLOY_DIR         live deploy dir           (/home/team_a/TEKIJIN)
#   TEKIJIN_VENV_PY            backend venv python       (…/tekijin-bench/.venv/bin/python)
#   TEKIJIN_API_BASE_URL       baked into the frontend   (http://100.118.131.67:18000)
#   TEKIJIN_FRONTEND_CONTAINER frontend container name   (tekijin_frontend)
#   TEKIJIN_PORT               backend port              (18000)
#   TEKIJIN_FRONTEND_PORT      frontend port             (13000)
