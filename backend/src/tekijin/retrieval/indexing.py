"""Compute and store dense embeddings for the corpus (index-time side of C3).

Reads rows that carry an ``embedding`` column — employee profiles, questions,
answers, documents — encodes their text with an :class:`Embedder`, and writes
the vectors back into the pgvector columns. This is the counterpart to
:mod:`tekijin.retrieval.dense`, which reads those vectors at query time.

The function is embedder-agnostic (dependency-injected), so tests exercise it
with a deterministic fake, while ``scripts/embed_fixtures.py`` wires in the real
:class:`SentenceTransformerEmbedder`.
