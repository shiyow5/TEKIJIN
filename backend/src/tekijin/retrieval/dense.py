"""Dense (vector) retrieval over pgvector.

Runs an exact (brute-force) nearest-neighbour scan against the ``embedding``
columns using pgvector's cosine distance operator — no ANN index (ivfflat/hnsw)
exists yet, so there is no recall loss. Rows whose embedding is ``NULL`` (not yet
indexed) are excluded. Distance is converted to a cosine *similarity*
(``1 - distance``) so higher is better, matching the BM25 and RRF conventions.

Only the ordering feeds RRF downstream; the similarity is returned for
diagnostics and thresholding. An ivfflat/hnsw index is the future scaling lever
once row counts grow past the current demo corpus.
