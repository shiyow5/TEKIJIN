"""Hybrid retriever (component C4): Dense + BM25 fused with RRF.

Ties the pieces together: embed the query (C3), run dense pgvector search and
in-memory BM25 in parallel channels, and fuse each channel's ranked ids with
Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Produces the C4 output shape consumed by the route
selector (#30) and the agent (#31):

    {
      "past_answers":    [{"qa_id", "score", "responder_id"}, ...],
      "documents":       [{"doc_id", "score"}, ...],
      "candidate_people": [employee_id, ...],
    }

``candidate_people`` is built by round-robin interleaving (responder-first) the
responders of the fused past answers with the profile-match ranking — dense and
sparse (BM25) self-introduction hits fused with RRF — then de-duplicated. The
interleave (rather than "all responders, then profiles") keeps an exact profile
match from being crowded out of ``top_k`` by many answer responders; see
:meth:`_aggregate_people`.
