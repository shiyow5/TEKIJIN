"""Read-only lookups backing the notification bell (GET /notifications).

No generic notification table: every notification kind is derived directly
from ``Recommendation`` rows, each durably identified by a specific
``(rank, outcome)`` shape (see each function's docstring). "Seen" state lives
on a dedicated ``Recommendation.<kind>_seen_at`` column per kind (set by the
matching ``data.writes.ack_*_notifications`` function).

Two audiences share this module:

- The **asker** side (``notifications_for_asker``): declined (#E7) and
  accepted (#509) outcomes on their own questions.
- The **responder** side (``pending_request_notifications_for_responder``,
  #509): new incoming requests still awaiting their decision — the same
  "pending" shape ``data.inbox.pending_handoffs_for_responder`` lists, plus
  the "not yet seen in the bell" filter.

    A decline event is durably identified as a ``rank == 1``,

    writes the primary recommendation's outcome, and a reroute's next
    candidate gets a FRESH ``rank == 1`` row (see ``agent/nodes.py::reroute``
    / ``c6_score``), so this predicate selects each historical decline event
