"""Read-only lookup for the responder inbox (GET /inbox).

Lists the questions where an employee is the *currently handed-off* responder and
the handoff is still pending. The pending handoff itself lives in the graph
checkpointer keyed by ``session_id`` (never in SQL), so the SQL proxy for
"responder X is being asked and hasn't answered" is a **rank-1 recommendation
with ``outcome IS NULL``**. The question carries the ``session_id`` (persisted at
/ask, #123), so each item can deep-link into ``/answer/{session_id}``.

Rows whose question predates session tracking (``session_id IS NULL`` — seeded
history) are skipped: they have no live handoff to open.
