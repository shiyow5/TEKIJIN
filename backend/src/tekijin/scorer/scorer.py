"""C6 expertise scorer: rank candidate people with explainable reasons.

Deterministic, LLM-free. Given a question topic and the candidate people C4
retrieved, it recomputes each person's topic edge from raw evidence and combines
it with recency, answer quality, proximity, and a load penalty into a single
score (technical-spec §5). It returns the top-k with a per-term ``reasons``
breakdown — the explanation the UI shows and the project's answer to "誤推薦対策".

``now`` is injected (never read from the clock) so the load window and recency
are reproducible; ties break on ``person_id`` so the ranking is stable.
