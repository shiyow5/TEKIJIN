    # the eval corpus a matching answer's qsim lands in the same range as a strong
    # topic_fit contribution (~0.45), which is why the two behave co-equally there.

    # so if the embedding model is swapped and qsim's distribution shifts upward the

    # embedder (scripts/research_c6_qsim.py sweeps this weight).

    # predicts the wrong topic it scores the gold expert against the wrong tag and

    # answers; adding it lifts the expert whose answers actually match the question
    # regardless of the (possibly wrong) topic label. It is applied ONLY when the
    # scorer is given a ``question_similarity`` map (feature-gated by

    # byte-identical. Calibrated on scripts/research_c6_qsim.py: at 1.0 the qsim
    # term is co-equal with topic_fit and lifts real-C1 Hit@3 0.742->0.807, with
    # the gain concentrated on the rows where C1 mispredicts the topic (Hit@3 on
    # those rows 0.444->0.778). C5 does not read the scorer, so this never changes
