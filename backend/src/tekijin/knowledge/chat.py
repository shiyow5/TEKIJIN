"""Group raw employee chat into conversation units for knowledge extraction (#448).

Raw chat is mostly noise — a single line ("了解です" / "在宅です") carries no
reusable knowledge, and feeding raw messages to System 1 as evidence measured as
near-useless (and harmful when combined with daily reports). The value in chat is
in the *exchanges*: a question that gets a substantive answer, an issue that gets
resolved. So the unit of extraction is a **conversation**, not a message.

This module turns ``employee_chat_history`` rows into
:class:`~tekijin.knowledge.extract.ExtractionSource` transcripts by grouping
consecutive messages in the same channel that fall within a time gap. The
:class:`~tekijin.knowledge.extract.CaseExtractor` then distils each transcript
into a case (``問題 → 打ち手/回答 → 結果``), leaning hard on ``extractable=false`` so
chit-chat and logistics store nothing. Chat has no precomputed tags, so topics are
inferred from the model's hints and snapped to the canonical vocabulary by
``extract_and_store(..., infer_topics_from_hints=True)``.

Pure DB reads + in-memory grouping — no LLM, no network — so tests drive it against
the seeded fixtures deterministically.
