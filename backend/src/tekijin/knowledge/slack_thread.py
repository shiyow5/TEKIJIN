"""A resolved hand-off thread as a knowledge-extraction input (#476 Screen 02).

When a participant marks a Slack pair-channel thread solved (a ✅ reaction), the
resolved Q&A becomes a candidate *case*: the question is the 課題, the answer /
follow-up chat is the 打ち手 / 結果. This module assembles that thread into the
same :class:`~tekijin.knowledge.extract.ExtractionSource` the daily-report and chat
pipelines feed, so extraction, topic provenance, and idempotent storage are shared
— a Slack thread is just a new ``source_type``.

Provenance-faithful, like the other sources: the unit's topics come from the
QUESTION's precomputed tags (never the model), so the knowledge vocabulary cannot
drift. The source id is derived from the thread id, so re-reacting on the same
thread refreshes the same draft in place rather than creating duplicates.
