"""Application service that drives the C1-C8 agent behind the HTTP API.

One :class:`AgentService` is created per process and shared across requests. It
holds the long-lived pieces (checkpointer, embedder, LLM nodes, sessionmaker) and
builds a *fresh* graph per stream (bound to a fresh DB session), so no SQLAlchemy
session is shared across requests. Interrupt/resume is carried by the shared
checkpointer keyed on ``thread_id == session_id`` — a graph rebuilt for a later
request resumes the earlier paused state.

Durability & concurrency (the core of this design):

* **Persistence identity lives in the durable checkpoint, not memory.** The
  ``question_id`` (a ``uuid4``) rides in the ``AgentState`` from ``/ask``; the DB
  ids of the shown recommendations — and the ``primary_recommendation_id`` whose
  outcome is later recorded — are written back into the state with
  ``graph.update_state`` after C6. So ``/answer`` records the outcome by reading
  ``graph.get_state(config).values`` and survives an eviction / restart. As a
  belt-and-suspenders fallback (e.g. a disconnect before ``update_state`` ran),
  the outcome target is re-derivable from the DB by ``question_id``.
* **A per-session lock makes accept, resume and stream mutually exclusive.** The
  in-memory registry shrinks to just "the next input to run" plus a TTL stamp;
  every state-transition (accept / resume / consume-and-stream) runs under the
  session's lock, so concurrent ``/ask`` cannot double-insert, concurrent
  ``/answer`` cannot drop an outcome, and concurrent ``/events`` cannot start the
  graph twice (double recommendation rows).
* **Eviction never drops a paused session.** ``_sweep`` skips any session that is
  mid-interrupt (a human is being waited on), so long HITL pauses are safe.

This still requires the API to run SINGLE worker (the lock + registry are
in-process); that is documented on the Makefile ``serve-prod`` target.
