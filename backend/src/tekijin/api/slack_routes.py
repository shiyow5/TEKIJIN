"""Slack account linking, login and events.

Endpoints: ``GET /slack/authorize-url``, ``POST /slack/login-url``,
``GET /slack/oauth/start``, ``GET /slack/oauth/callback``,
``POST /slack/link/complete``, ``GET /slack/status``, ``POST /slack/unlink``,
``POST /slack/events``, ``POST /slack/interactivity``.

"Sign in with Slack" account linking, independent of whether DM notifications
are turned on (``Settings.slack_notifications_enabled``) — an employee can link
before a bot token exists; notifications simply stay off until one does. The
callback is a plain browser redirect from Slack with no ``Authorization``
header, so it cannot tell who is linking — and it does not try. It hands the
frontend a short-lived pending token, redeemed with the frontend's own bearer
token (``POST /slack/link/complete``).

Both halves of a link name an identity: the ``state`` names the employee who
STARTED it, the pending token names the Slack account that CONSENTED, and the
bearer names who is FINISHING it. Every attack this flow has seen took one half
from the attacker and the other from the victim — in both directions — so the
starter and the finisher must be the same person (#494). Login is different: it
has no session to finish with, so it is bound to the browser by a nonce cookie
issued at ``/slack/oauth/start``, on the callback's own origin.

``POST /slack/events`` is the Slack -> TEKIJIN direction (#388, #hand-off-chat):
Slack's Events API calls this directly (no TEKIJIN principal — it
authenticates itself via a request signature instead,
:func:`tekijin.slack.verify.verify_signature`). A message posted in a
hand-off's shared Slack channel is routed to whichever TEKIJIN thread that
channel's ``current_thread_id`` currently names (see
``tekijin.slack.notify``'s module docstring) — no relay back into Slack is
needed here, since both parties already see each other's messages natively
in the same channel; this only mirrors them into TEKIJIN.
