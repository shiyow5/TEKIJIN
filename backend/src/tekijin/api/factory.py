"""Build the default production :class:`AgentService` from settings.

Wires the real pieces: a sessionmaker over the configured database, the selected
checkpointer (memory/postgres with fallback), the lazy SentenceTransformer
embedder (no model loaded until first ``encode``), and the selected LLM backend
(stub/vllm). All construction here is cheap and import-light — no DB connection,
no model download, no LangChain OpenAI import on the stub path.
