"""Shared graph state for the C1-C8 agent flow.

``AgentState`` is the single ``TypedDict`` threaded through the LangGraph
``StateGraph``. Every node returns a *partial* update (a dict with only the keys
it changed); LangGraph merges those into the running state. Keys are grouped by
the component that writes them (C1 intent, C2 sufficiency, … C8 update) plus a
few control keys (``now``, ``answer``, decline loop).

Nothing here reads the clock or the network — ``now`` is injected by the caller
so the whole run is reproducible.
