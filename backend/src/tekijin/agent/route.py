"""C5: deterministic route decision (確信度 × 閾値).

Chooses how to resolve the question — no LLM, no randomness. Crucially it routes
on **absolute cosine similarity** (each channel's top dense ``1 - distance``,
supplied by C4 as ``*_confidence``), NOT on RRF fusion scores: an RRF score is a
sum of ``1/(k+rank)`` and has no absolute meaning across queries, so a fixed
threshold against it is meaningless. Cosine similarity is comparable, so the
thresholds below are real "how close is it?" gates. This also resolves the
dense-similarity floor deferred from #29.

Threshold rationale is **model-specific** — cosine absolute values depend on the
embedding. These constants are calibrated to Nemotron-3-Embed-1B, whose cosines
are heavily compressed (observed range ~0.04–0.57 on the eval corpus, not the
0.6–0.95 spread of e5/BERT-style encoders). See ``docs/adr/0004`` and
``fixtures/synthetic/eval/route_calibration.json`` (#90, recalibrated on the
66-item basis in #191). Calibrated bands (routed-set accuracy 0.818 vs 0.742
majority, 66-item basis):

* ``DOCUMENT_SIM`` = 0.28 — a document is on-topic enough to be the demotion
  target. Recalibrated 0.30→0.28 in #191: on the current corpus 0.30 both dipped
  document recall to 4/10 and pushed the single-route share to 0.95 (the collapse
  ceiling); 0.28 restores recall to 5/10, lifts overall accuracy 0.803→0.818, and
  drops the share back to 0.94. The three lowest document golds (conf
  0.166/0.177/0.189) cannot be recovered without collapsing accuracy below the
  majority baseline — that is the corpus-count-routing job (#116/#119), not a
  threshold job.
* ``PERSON_WEAK_SIM`` = 0.40 — profile match below this counts as weak, letting a
  document take over (sits inside the observed 0.053–0.454 people range).
* ``PRIOR_ANSWER_SIM`` = 0.55 — **deliberately above the observed answer-cosine
  max (0.543): prior_answer never fires with Nemotron.** ``answer_confidence``
  cannot separate this route — person-gold rows reach 0.543 while prior_answer
  gold tops out at 0.410, so any firing threshold mislabels person first. Prior-
  answer detection is therefore disabled here and moved to corpus-count routing
  (answers.reuse_count / answer existence), tracked in #119. This is a #90
  stopgap, not the intended design.

Routes:
* ``prior_answer`` — a past QA is *very* close: present who answered before, then
  hand off to that responder (flowchart PA → C6). **Dormant under Nemotron** —
  see the PRIOR_ANSWER_SIM note above (#119).
* ``document`` — the person signal is weak but a document is strongly on-topic:
  point at where it lives (答えは作らない).
* ``person`` — the main line and the default/fallback.
