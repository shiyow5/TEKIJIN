"""Assemble the C1-C8 flow as a LangGraph ``StateGraph``.

The wiring mirrors the model-definition §1 flowchart one-to-one: rounded boxes
become ``add_node`` and diamonds become ``add_conditional_edges``. LLM nodes
(C1/C2/C7) default to the deterministic stubs; the retriever (C4) and scorer (C6)
default to the real modules but are injectable, so tests can force any branch
without a model, a network call, or retrieval nondeterminism.

Persistence uses an injected checkpointer (default ``MemorySaver``); #32 swaps in
``PostgresSaver`` without touching this graph. ``thread_id`` (per session) drives
``interrupt``/``resume``.
